INTRODUCTION:

Augmented Reality (AR) is a rapidly evolving technology that overlays digital content onto the physical world, enhancing real-world experiences through interactive and immersive visualizations. One of the foundational techniques in AR is marker-based detection, where visual markers are used to anchor virtual elements in a real-world environment. AR marker detection involves identifying predefined patterns, such as QR codes or fiducial markers, using a device's camera and then aligning virtual objects relative to these markers in real time.
This project explores the principles, design, and implementation of AR marker detection systems. It focuses on detecting and tracking AR markers using computer vision algorithms, thereby enabling dynamic interaction between the physical and virtual worlds. The study also evaluates the performance and accuracy of various marker detection libraries and techniques, aiming to contribute to applications in fields such as education, entertainment, manufacturing, and navigation.


Abstract:

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that merges virtual content with the real world, enhancing user interaction and perception. Marker-based AR is a widely used approach that relies on the detection of predefined visual patterns, known as markers, to accurately place and render virtual objects in a physical environment. This project focuses on the development and implementation of an AR marker detection system using computer vision techniques. By utilizing libraries such as OpenCV and ARToolKit (or alternatives), the system identifies and tracks markers in real-time through a device’s camera feed, enabling the overlay of 3D models or information aligned with the physical markers.
The project investigates the effectiveness of various marker types, detection algorithms, and tracking methods, aiming to optimize performance, accuracy, and responsiveness. Applications of such systems span across multiple domains, including education, gaming, industrial maintenance, and advertising. The results demonstrate the potential of marker-based AR as a cost-effective and efficient solution for creating interactive and immersive experiences.
